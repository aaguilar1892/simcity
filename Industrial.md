**Brief description**

The Industrial Functionality component of the city simulation is responsible for modeling the growth and dynamics of industrial zones. This involves determining when industrial zones can expand, tracking their population, generating pollution, and interacting with other components of the simulation, such as the workforce and the goods market.

The Pollution Functionality component handles the generation, spread, and tracking of pollution within the city.  It is closely tied to the Industrial Functionality, as industrial zones are the primary source of pollution.

**Data Storage/Maintenance**

The core data structure used to represent industrial zones, as well as the other zones, is the Zone object as a list data structure, mainList. Each Zone object stores the essential attributes, coordinates, zone type, population, and pollution. The coordinates are in the form of x and y variables to store the location of the zone within the region grid. The zone type indicates if the zone is industrial, represented as an "I". Population contains the number of workers inhabiting the industrial zone. And finally, pollution; it houses the level of pollution generated by this zone.

**Component Functionality**

_**Major functions used**_

The core functions responsible for this include CheckAdjZonesI(), setPollutionLevel(), and spreadPollution() within the Zone class.

_**How do the functions work**_

The CheckAdjZonesI() function drives industrial expansion. It analyzes each industrial zone and examines its adjacent zones. If certain conditions are met (such as sufficient workers, power, and surrounding population), the zone's population increases, signifying industrial growth. Data is transformed within this function as population counts, worker availability, and pollution levels are modified.

The setPollutionLevel() function directly sets the pollution level of an industrial zone based on its population; more population equals more pollution.

The spreadPollution() function models how pollution disperses from industrial zones. It iterates through the map, and for each populated industrial zone, it decreases the pollution level by one and spreads that pollution to directly adjacent zones. This function effectively simulates the diffusion of pollution from its source.

_**How is data transformed**_

The core data point that undergoes transformation is zone population. This value increases to reflect industrial growth when specific conditions are met. Worker Availability is a condition. There must be sufficient workers in the zone to support industrial expansion. The simulation might decrement the worker count as they are employed by the growing industries. Another condition, Population Threshold, where the zone's existing population might need to be below a certain limit to accommodate further growth.
Another data point that's transformed is pollution level. This directly correlates with the zone's population; a higher population generates more pollution. The setPollutionLevel() function implements this relationship.

When an industrial zone meets the growth conditions, its population is incremented. Workers might be decremented to reflect their roles within the new industries. This data transfer signifies the zone's industrial expansion.

The spreadPollution() function simulates how pollution moves from industrial zones. It reduces the pollution level in an industrial zone by one and distributes that pollution to its neighboring zones. This process iterates throughout the map, modelling the diffusion of pollution.

_**How is data read in**_

The simulation reads data primarily from the configuration file read in by the InitializeSim() function. This file provides the initial map layout, zone types, time limits, and refresh rates. 

_**How is data outputted**_

The function CheckAdjZonesI() is a void function, returning nothing. The arguments on the other hand, are pass by reference and update its respective variables. The output functions printOutput(), printArea(), printPop(), and printPollution() display the simulation results in various formats.  They provide a visual map of the region, calculate population densities for each zone type, and present a pollution map to illustrate the environmental impact of industrialization.
